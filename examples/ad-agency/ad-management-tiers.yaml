              Your first weekly performance report is ready!
              
              Log in to your dashboard to see:
              
              - Current campaign performance
              - Key metrics and trends
              - What we've optimized
              - What we're testing next
              
              This is just the beginning. Performance typically improves 
              significantly over the first 30-60 days as we learn what 
              works best for your audience.
