                              You know ads work. You've seen competitors scale with Meta and TikTok. You're ready to invest in paid acquisition.
                      
                              But the thought of actually setting it all up? Overwhelming.
                      
                              - Which campaign objective should you use?
                              - How do you build audiences that actually convert?
                              - What creatives will work for YOUR business?
                              - Is your pixel even installed correctly?
                              - How do you know if your ads are actually profitable?
                      
                              You could spend months learning all of this. Or you could have experts build it for you in a week.

                              Imagine having a team of media buyers handle everything:

                              **Week 3:** We launch your campaigns and start optimizing
                              **Weeks 4-5:** We optimize daily and deliver weekly reports
                      
                              At the end of 30 days, you have profitable campaigns running on autopilot.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              I noticed you applied for the Campaign Setup Package but 
              haven't booked your strategy call yet.
              
              I wanted to check in because:
              
              - We only take on a limited number of new clients each month
              - The sooner we chat, the sooner your campaigns can be live
              - I have some questions about your application I'd love to discuss
              
              If you're serious about launching profitable ad campaigns, 
              book a time and let's talk strategy.
