                              Creative fatigue is silently killing your ad performance.
                      
                              Your audiences have seen the same images and videos dozens of times. CTRs are dropping. CPAs are climbing. And Meta's algorithm is punishing you for it.
                      
                              You know you need fresh creatives. But...
                      
                              - Hiring a full-time designer costs $50K+/year (and they might not even understand ads)
                              - Freelancers are unreliable and require constant management
                              - DIY means spending hours in Canva when you should be running your business
                              - Creative agencies charge $5K+ for a single campaign
                      
                              Meanwhile, your competitors are pumping out fresh creatives every week while your ads get stale.

                              Every month, you receive 10-15 brand-new ad creatives. Static images, video ads, carousel formats. All designed specifically for your brand and ready to upload.
                      
                              You submit a brief. We deliver. You test. Your ads stay fresh.
                      
                              No hiring. No managing. No creative bottlenecks.
                      
                              Just a predictable monthly package of high-quality creatives that keep your ads performing.

              I noticed you applied for the Creative Retainer but haven't 
              booked your discovery call yet.
              
              I wanted to check in because:
              
              - We have limited spots available each month
              - The sooner we chat, the sooner you can get fresh creatives
              - I have some questions about your application I'd love to discuss
              
              If you're serious about solving your creative fatigue problem, 
              book a time and let's talk.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Now that you've received your first batch, here's how the 
              ongoing rhythm works:
              
              **Week 1:** Submit your brief (or update it)
              **Week 2:** First batch delivered
              **Week 3:** Second batch + revisions
              **Week 4:** Final batch + prep for next month
              
              **Need changes?** Request unlimited revisions anytime 
              through your portal. We turn them around in 48 hours.
              
              **New campaign coming up?** Submit an updated brief with 
              new messaging, offers, or creative direction.
              
              **Feedback on what's working?** Let us know which creatives 
              are performing and we'll create more in that style.
