                              You started running ads because you needed customers. But now ads are running you.
                      
                              Every day it's the same cycle:
                              - Check Ads Manager first thing in the morning
                              - Stress about rising CPAs and inconsistent ROAS
                              - Wonder if you should kill that campaign or give it more time
                              - Spend hours creating new audiences and creatives
                              - Fall behind on actually running your business
                      
                              You've thought about hiring someone, but...
                      
                              - Full-time media buyers cost $60K-$100K+ per year
                              - Freelancers are hit-or-miss and require constant management
                              - Agencies want 15-20% of ad spend (that's $3K-$6K/month on a $30K budget)
                      
                              What if there was a better way?

                              Imagine this:
                      
                              Every morning, you wake up to results - not tasks. Your campaigns are running, optimizing, and scaling while you sleep.
                      
                              Every week, you get a clear report showing exactly what's happening with your ads. No jargon. No confusion. Just results.
                      
                              Every month, you hop on a strategy call to discuss what's working and what's next. Then you go back to running your business.
                      
                              That's what full ad management looks like.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              I noticed you applied for Monthly Ad Management but haven't 
              booked your discovery call yet.
              
              I wanted to reach out because:
              
              - We only take on 2-3 new management clients each month
              - Discovery calls fill up quickly
              - The sooner we chat, the sooner we can start improving 
                your results
              
              If you're serious about handing off your ad management to 
              experts, book a time and let's talk.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've been with us for a week now, and we wanted to give 
              you a quick update on what's happened.
              
              **What we've done:**
              ✓ Completed full account audit
              ✓ Implemented initial optimizations
              ✓ Set up tracking verification
              ✓ Established baseline metrics
              ✓ Started daily monitoring
              
              **What you should see:**
              - Your first weekly report arrived Monday
