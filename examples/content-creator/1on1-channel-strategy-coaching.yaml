              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              This is my last follow-up about your coaching application.
              
              If the timing isn't right, I totally understand. Growing a 
              YouTube channel takes serious commitment, and coaching isn't 
              for everyone.
              
              But if you're ready to invest in personalized guidance and 
              want to accelerate your growth, book that call.
              
              After this, I'll assume you're not interested and won't 
              email about coaching again.
