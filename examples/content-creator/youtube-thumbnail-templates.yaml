                      You spend hours making a great video. The content is solid. The editing is tight.
                      
                      You hit publish... and crickets.
                      
                      Your impressions are decent, but nobody's clicking. Your CTR is stuck at 2-4%, while you watch other creators in your niche get 10%+ on every video.
                      
                      You've tried:
                      
                      - Copying what big creators do (but it doesn't look right)
                      - Using bright colors and big text (still no clicks)
                      - Making faces at the camera (feels awkward, doesn't work)
                      - Spending hours in Canva trying different designs (still guessing)
                      
                      The frustrating part? You KNOW your content is good. But the algorithm won't push it if people don't click.
                      
                      **What if you had templates that were already proven to get clicks?**

                      Here's what I've learned from growing multiple channels to over 1 million subscribers combined:
                      
                      **Your thumbnail is 80% of whether someone clicks.**
                      
                      Not your title. Not your topic. Your thumbnail.
                      
                      YouTube shows your video to a small test audience first. If they click, you get shown to more people. If they don't, your video dies.
                      
                      The difference between a 3% CTR and a 10% CTR can be the difference between 10,000 views and 100,000 views. On the same video.
                      
                      But here's the thing most creators get wrong: good thumbnails follow patterns.
                      
                      There are specific layouts, color combinations, and psychological triggers that consistently drive clicks. Once you know them, you can use them over and over.
                      
                      That's exactly what these templates give you.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              After analyzing thousands of thumbnails across my channels 
              and my students' channels, one element stands out above all 
              others:
              
              **Faces with strong emotion.**
              
              Thumbnails with expressive faces get 2-3x more clicks than 
              thumbnails without faces. It's not even close.
              
              Why? Our brains are wired to notice faces. It's evolution. 
              When we see a face showing surprise, excitement, or curiosity, 
              we can't help but look.
              
              **Here's how to do it right:**
              
              1. Use a photo where your eyes are visible (no sunglasses)
              2. Exaggerate your expression (what feels "too much" on camera 
                 looks normal in a thumbnail)
              3. Make sure your face takes up at least 25% of the thumbnail
              4. Position your face off-center for visual interest
              
              The "Big Reaction" and "Curiosity Gap" templates in your pack 
              are specifically designed for this. Try one on your next video!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              One of the most common mistakes I see creators make:
              
              **Putting too much text on their thumbnails.**
              
              Remember, most people see your thumbnail on their phone 
              at a tiny size. If you can't read your text at phone-screen 
              size, it's not helping you.
              
              **The rules I follow:**
              
              1. Maximum 3-4 words on a thumbnail (ideally 1-2)
              2. Text should be readable in 1 second or less
              3. Use text to create curiosity, not to explain the video
              4. Contrast text color against background (white or yellow 
                 work well)
              
              **Here's the key insight:** Your thumbnail and title work 
              TOGETHER. Don't repeat the same info in both. Your thumbnail 
              should complement your title, not duplicate it.
              
              The "Question Hook" and "Shocking Stat" templates in your 
              pack use text effectively. Notice how little text there is, 
              and how impactful each word is.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Color isn't just about making your thumbnail look good. It's 
              about making it STAND OUT in a sea of other videos.
              
              **Colors that perform best:**
              
              - Yellow: Grabs attention, creates urgency
              - Red: Creates excitement, signals importance
              - Blue: Builds trust (great for educational content)
              - Green: Associated with money, growth, success
              
              **Colors to use carefully:**
              
              - White/Gray: Can look washed out or boring
              - Black: Can be too dark, hard to see details
              - Purple: Less common, can work for luxury/creative niches
              
              **The secret:** Look at what other creators in your niche 
              are using, then do the OPPOSITE. If everyone uses blue 
              thumbnails, try red or yellow. You want to stand out, not 
              blend in.
              
              Check your recent thumbnails: Do they stand out in your 
              niche's typical color palette? If not, try something different 
              on your next video.
