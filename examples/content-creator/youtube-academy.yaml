                              - Your videos get 50-100 views no matter how hard you try

                              - You're frustrated because you KNOW your content is good
                      
                              The algorithm feels like a mystery, and you're tired of guessing what works.

                              ✓ The SEO strategy that gets you discovered
                              ✓ How to turn viewers into loyal subscribers
                              ✓ When to monetize and how much you can make
                      
                              That's what YouTube Academy gives you. The same system I used to grow to 100K.

              Quick check-in: Have you started Module 1 (YouTube Foundations)?
              
              This module is crucial because it explains how the algorithm 
              ACTUALLY works. Most creators have it completely wrong.
              
              **Key lessons in Module 1:**
              - Why the algorithm isn't your enemy
              - The 4 signals YouTube uses to rank videos
              - How to set up your channel for success
              - Branding basics that build recognition
              
              If you haven't started yet, now is the perfect time!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Module 2 might save your channel.
              
              I've seen SO many creators waste months (or years) in the wrong 
              niche. They create great content, but the audience just isn't there.
              
              **Module 2 covers:**
              - How to research niche demand
              - Finding low-competition opportunities
              - Positioning your unique angle
              - When to pivot (and when to stay)
              
              Even if you think your niche is fine, do the exercises in this 
              module. You might discover a better positioning.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've been a YouTube Academy student for 2 weeks now!
              
              **Quick progress check:**
              
              - Have you completed Modules 1-4?
              - Have you applied the thumbnail strategies?
              - Have you introduced yourself in the community?
              
              If you're behind, that's okay! Life happens. But try to carve 
              out 30 minutes this week to make progress.
              
              **Pro tip:** Module 5 (Thumbnail & Title Mastery) is where most 
              students see their first CTR improvements. Prioritize it!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              3 weeks in! Have you hit any milestones?
              
              **Common wins students share:**
              - First 100/1,000 subscribers
              - First viral video (1K+ views)
              - First positive CTR improvements
              - First monetization check
              - First sponsorship inquiry
              
              If you've had ANY win - big or small - share it in the Wins 
              space in the community. We love celebrating with you!
              
              And if you're still working toward your first milestone, 
              keep going. Consistency beats everything.
