                              You've taken the courses. You've watched the YouTube videos. You know the theory.
                      
                              But when it comes to pulling the trigger on an actual deal, something holds you back:
                      
                              - Is this ARV realistic, or am I being too optimistic?
                              - Did I estimate repairs correctly?
                              - What if I miss something and lose money?
                              - How do I negotiate with this specific seller?
                              - Is this deal actually as good as it looks?
                      
                              **The gap between learning and doing is where most investors get stuck.**
                      
                              You don't need another course. You need someone who's done hundreds of deals to look at YOUR specific situation and tell you exactly what to do.

                            Question: "What's the time commitment between sessions?"
                            Answer: "That depends on your goals. If you want to close deals quickly, expect to spend 10-20 hours per week on your investing business (marketing, analyzing deals, talking to sellers, etc.). I'll help you prioritize."

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Thanks for applying to 1:1 Deal Coaching. I review every 
              application personally to make sure we're a good fit.
              
              **What happens next:**
              
              1. Book your discovery call (if you haven't already)
              2. We hop on a 30-minute call to discuss your situation
              3. If we're a good fit, I'll share how we can work together
              
              If you haven't booked your call yet, do that now. I only 
              work with a handful of coaching clients at a time.

              I noticed you applied for 1:1 Deal Coaching but haven't 
              booked your discovery call yet.

              they need.
              
              If you're serious about closing deals in the next 90 days 
              and want personalized guidance, let's chat.

              I wanted to check in one more time about your application 
              to 1:1 Deal Coaching.
              
              I know life gets busy, so I understand if the timing isn't 
              right. But if you're still interested in:
              
              - Getting personalized guidance on your specific deals
              - Having an experienced investor in your corner
              - Closing your first (or next) deal in the next 90 days
              
              ...then let's get you scheduled for a discovery call.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Welcome to 1:1 Deal Coaching! I'm excited to work with you 
              over the next 3 months.
              
              **Your first step:** Log in to your client portal and 
              complete the quick onboarding. You'll need to:
              
              1. Sign the coaching agreement
              2. Complete the client intake form
              
              This takes about 5 minutes and helps me prepare for our 
              first session.

              **Once you're set up:**
              
              1. Book your first coaching session
              2. Download the resources (deal analyzer, templates)
              3. Prepare any deals you want to discuss
              
              I'm looking forward to helping you close deals!
