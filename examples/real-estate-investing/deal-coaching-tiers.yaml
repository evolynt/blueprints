                      You've done the research. You know real estate investing works. But when it comes to actually pulling the trigger on deals, something holds you back.
                      
                      Maybe you're not sure if your numbers are right. Maybe you're afraid of making a costly mistake. Maybe you just need someone experienced to guide you through your first (or next) deals.
                      
                      **That's exactly what Deal Coaching provides.**
                      
                      I work with investors at all levels - from those looking for basic guidance to close their first deal, to experienced investors scaling their portfolios who want JV partnerships and direct access to my network.
                      
                      Whatever level you're at, there's a coaching tier designed for your goals.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Thanks for applying to Deal Coaching. I review every 
              application personally to understand your situation and goals.
              
              **What happens next:**
              
              1. Book your discovery call (if you haven't already)
              2. We hop on a 30-minute call to discuss your goals
              3. I'll recommend the best coaching tier for your situation
              4. If we're a good fit, we can get started right away
              
              If you haven't booked your call yet, do that now. I only 
              work with a limited number of clients at each tier.

              I noticed you applied for Deal Coaching but haven't 
              booked your discovery call yet.
              
              Just a reminder - I work with a limited number of clients 
              at each tier to ensure everyone gets the attention they need.
              
              If you're serious about closing more deals and want 
              personalized guidance, let's chat.

              I wanted to check in one more time about your Deal 
              Coaching application.

              isn't right. But if you're still interested in:

              - An experienced investor in your corner
              - Closing more deals in the next 3-12 months
              
              ...then let's schedule a discovery call.

              If you've decided coaching isn't for you, no hard feelings. 
              Just reply and let me know.
              
              Either way, I wish you success in your investing!
