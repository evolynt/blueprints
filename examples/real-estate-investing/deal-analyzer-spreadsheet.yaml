                              You found a property that looks like a good deal. The seller seems motivated. The numbers look okay... maybe?
                      
                              But then the doubt creeps in:
                      
                              - Is the ARV estimate realistic, or am I being too optimistic?
                              - Did I account for ALL the repair costs?
                              - What about holding costs, closing costs, and unexpected expenses?
                              - Is there actually profit here, or am I about to lose my shirt?
                      
                              You've seen the horror stories. Investors who bought "great deals" that turned into money pits. Wholesalers who assigned contracts only to have buyers back out when the numbers didn't work.
                      
                              **The difference between successful investors and struggling ones? They know their numbers BEFORE they make offers.**

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              The biggest mistake I see new investors make? **Overestimating ARV.**
              
              It's easy to do. You find the highest comp in the neighborhood 
              and assume your property will sell for the same price. But that's 
              a recipe for losing money.
              
              **Here's what I do instead:**
              
              1. Find 3-5 SOLD comps (not active listings) within 0.5 miles
              2. Adjust for differences (beds, baths, square footage, condition)
              3. Use the AVERAGE of adjusted values, not the highest
              4. Subtract 5% as a safety margin
              
              The Deal Analyzer has an ARV calculator built in that helps you 
              do this systematically. Make sure you're using it!
              
              **Your homework:** Find a property on Zillow or Redfin and run 
              it through the spreadsheet using conservative ARV assumptions.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              "But I'm not a contractor - how do I estimate repair costs?"
              
              I hear this all the time. Here's the truth: you don't need to be 
              a contractor to get repair estimates in the right ballpark.
              
              **My simple system:**
              
              1. **Light cosmetic:** $10-15/sq ft (paint, carpet, fixtures)
              2. **Medium rehab:** $25-35/sq ft (kitchen/bath updates, some systems)
              3. **Heavy rehab:** $45-60/sq ft (gut renovation, major systems)
              
              The Deal Analyzer has a repair estimator with common line items 
              and typical costs. Use it as a starting point, then adjust based 
              on your market.
              
              **Pro tip:** Get 2-3 contractor bids on your first few deals. 
              This helps you calibrate your estimates for future deals.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              I've seen investors lose money on deals that SHOULD have been 
              profitable. The culprit? Hidden costs they forgot to account for.
              
              **Costs most beginners forget:**
              
              - **Holding costs:** Mortgage, insurance, taxes, utilities while 
                you own the property (typically $1,500-3,000/month)
              - **Closing costs (buy side):** Title, attorney, transfer taxes 
                (1-2% of purchase price)
              - **Closing costs (sell side):** Agent commissions, title, 
                transfer taxes (8-10% of sale price)
              - **Contingency:** Always add 10-15% buffer for surprises
              
              The Deal Analyzer accounts for ALL of these. Make sure you're 
              filling in every section, not just purchase price and ARV.
              
              **Reality check:** A deal that looks like $30K profit on the 
              surface might only be $10K after all costs. Know your numbers!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              By now you've had a chance to use the Deal Analyzer Spreadsheet 
              on a few potential deals. Here's my question:
              
              **Are you stuck on a specific deal?**
              
              Maybe you're not sure if the ARV is realistic. Or the repair 
              estimate feels off. Or you just want a second set of eyes before 
              making an offer.
              
              I'm offering a **free 30-minute strategy call** where we can:
              
              - Analyze a specific deal together
              - Review your numbers and assumptions
              - Discuss your investing goals and next steps
              - Answer any questions you have
              
              No pitch, no pressure. Just real help with your real deals.
