                      You've done a few deals. You know real estate works. But finding quality opportunities is getting harder.
                      
                      The MLS is picked over. Wholesalers are sending you the same deals they blast to everyone. And when you do find something good, you're competing against 20 other offers.
                      
                      Meanwhile, experienced investors seem to have an endless pipeline of off-market opportunities. They're closing deals you never even knew existed.
                      
                      What's their secret? They have a network.
                      
                      Not just contacts - a real network of investors who share deals, collaborate on opportunities, and help each other win.

                      Imagine getting a notification that a member just posted a wholesale deal in your target market. Before it hits any list.
                      
                      Or connecting with an investor who has capital but needs boots on the ground - and that's exactly what you bring to the table.
                      
                      Or getting your question about a tricky rehab answered by someone who's done 50 of them.
                      
                      That's what the REI Investor Network provides: real deal flow, real connections, and real support from people who are actually doing deals.

                      2. **Your current challenges** - Where are you stuck?
                      3. **Your goals** - What do you want to achieve in the next year?

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              I noticed you applied for the REI Investor Network but 
              haven't booked your discovery call yet.
              
              Just a reminder - we keep the network small and curated, 
              so spots do fill up.
              
              If you're serious about:
              - Accessing off-market deal flow
              - Connecting with active investors
              - Building partnerships and JV opportunities
              
              Book your call and let's chat.
