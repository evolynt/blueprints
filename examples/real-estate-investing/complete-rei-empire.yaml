                      You found a property that looks like a good deal. The numbers look okay... maybe?
                      
                      But then the doubt creeps in:
                      
                      - Is the ARV estimate realistic?
                      - Did I account for ALL the repair costs?
                      - What about holding costs and closing costs?
                      - Is there actually profit here?
                      
                      **The difference between successful investors and struggling ones? They know their numbers BEFORE they make offers.**

                      Imagine plugging in a few numbers and instantly knowing:
                      
                      ✓ Your maximum allowable offer (MAO)
                      ✓ Projected profit on a flip

                      You've done the research. You know real estate works. But when it comes to pulling the trigger, something holds you back.
                      
                      Maybe you're not sure if your numbers are right. Maybe you need someone experienced to guide you through your deals.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              The biggest mistake I see? Overestimating ARV.
              
              **Here's what I do instead:**
              
              1. Find 3-5 SOLD comps within 0.5 miles
              2. Adjust for differences
              3. Use the AVERAGE, not the highest
              4. Subtract 5% safety margin
              
              The Deal Analyzer has an ARV calculator built in. Make sure 
              you're using it!

              Not a contractor? No problem.
              
              **My simple system:**
              
              - Light cosmetic: $10-15/sq ft
              - Medium rehab: $25-35/sq ft
              - Heavy rehab: $45-60/sq ft
              
              The Deal Analyzer has a repair estimator. Use it as your 
              starting point.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Costs most beginners forget:
              
              - **Holding costs:** $1,500-3,000/month
              - **Closing costs (buy):** 1-2% of purchase
              - **Closing costs (sell):** 8-10% of sale
              - **Contingency:** Always add 10-15%
              
              The Deal Analyzer accounts for ALL of these. Fill in every 
              section!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Now that you can analyze deals, where do you find them?
              
              That's where the **REI Investor Network** comes in.
              
              Members share off-market deals, connect for partnerships, 
              and join weekly Q&A calls.
              
              It's $197/month and many members say one deal from the 
              network paid for years of membership.
              
              Interested? Reply to this email and I'll share more details.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've been through the course. You have the knowledge.
              
              But if you want personalized guidance on YOUR specific deals, 
              consider 1:1 coaching.
              
              I work with a handful of clients, reviewing their deals and 
              helping them close faster.
              
              Interested? Reply and I'll share details.
