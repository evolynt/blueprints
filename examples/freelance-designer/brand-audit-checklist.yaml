              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              After working with 100+ businesses on their brands, the #1 mistake I see is **inconsistency**.
              
              Your logo might be great. Your colors might be on point. But if they're applied differently on your website, social media, and business cards... your brand looks amateur.
              
              When you complete your Brand Audit, pay special attention to Section 5: Consistency. This is where most brands lose points.
              
              **Quick fix:** Create a simple one-page brand guide with your logo, colors, and fonts. Share it with anyone who creates content for your business.
              
              Have you completed your audit yet? I'd love to hear what you discovered.
