                  This course teaches you proper form for the 5 essential 
                  barbell movements. Work through each module in order and 
                  practice with light weight before adding load.
                  
                  **Your learning path:**
                  1. Watch each video carefully
                  2. Practice with just the bar or light weight
                  3. Film yourself to check form
                  4. Move on once you feel confident
                  
                  Take your time. There's no rush.

                              You walk into the gym and stare at the barbell, wondering if you're about to build muscle or destroy your back.
                      
                              You've watched YouTube videos, but when you're actually standing there, you have no idea if your form is right.
                      
                              Every week that passes is another week of wasted gym sessions and potential injuries.

                              You start a new workout program, excited and motivated.
                      
                              Then life happens. You miss a day. Then two. Before you know it, you're back to square one.
                      
                              The truth is, fitness isn't just about having a program. It's about having support.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've had a week with Strength Foundations. How's it going?
              
              By now you should have worked through at least a few movement 
              tutorials. If you haven't had a chance yet, that's okay. The 
              course isn't going anywhere.
              
              A few tips as you practice:
              
              - Light weight is your friend right now
              - Film yourself to check your form
              - Feeling awkward is normal when learning
              
              Keep at it!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              It's been two weeks since you started Strength Foundations. 
              By now you should have a solid understanding of the 5 
              essential movements.
              
              So what's next?
              
              The foundation you've built is exactly that - a foundation. 
              Now it's time to build on it with progressive programming, 
              nutrition guidance, and ongoing accountability.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've been part of Fit Community for a month now. I hope 
              the weekly calls and community support have been valuable.
              
              I wanted to share something with you.
              
              Some members reach a point where they want MORE. More 
              personalization. More 1:1 attention. More accountability.
              
              That's what **Elite 1:1 Coaching** is for.
              
              With Elite Coaching, you get:
              
              ✓ 12 private coaching sessions

              ✓ Direct access to me between sessions
              ✓ Everything in the community (which you already have)
              
              It's our most intensive program for people who are serious 
              about transformation.
