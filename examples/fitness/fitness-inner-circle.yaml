                      You start a new workout program, excited and motivated. Week one goes great.
                      
                      Then life happens. You miss a day. Then two. Before you know it, you're back to square one, wondering why you can't stick to anything.
                      
                      Here's what's really going on:
                      
                      - You're working out alone with no one to hold you accountable
                      - When you hit a plateau, you have no idea what to change
                      - You're not sure if you're doing exercises correctly (and you're worried about injury)
                      - You don't have anyone to celebrate your wins with
                      
                      The truth is, fitness isn't just about having a program. It's about having support.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've been a member for a few days now. How's it going?
              
              I wanted to remind you about tomorrow's live coaching call. 
              It's happening Tuesday at 7pm ET, and it's a great chance to:
              
              - Get your form checked on any exercise
              - Ask questions about your program
              - Connect with other members live
              
              If you haven't introduced yourself in the community yet, now's 
              a perfect time. The members here are incredibly supportive, and 
              you'll get way more out of your membership when you engage.
              
              Remember: You don't have to go through this alone anymore.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've been part of the Inner Circle for a week now. 
              Congrats on taking action!
              
              I wanted to share a quick win from the community:
              
              "I've tried so many programs but always quit. The 
              accountability here is different. I actually look forward 
              to posting my workouts because I know people will celebrate 
              with me. Finally seeing real progress!" - Sarah M.
              
              That's what this community is all about. Real people, real 
              support, real results.
              
              If you haven't been as active as you'd like, that's okay. 
              Every day is a fresh start. Here's a simple challenge:
              
              1. Do one workout from the library this week
              2. Post about it in Wins & Progress
              3. Celebrate someone else's win
              
              Small steps lead to big transformations.
              
              See you inside!

              P.S. If the Inner Circle isn't what you expected, you can 
              cancel anytime with one click. But I hope you'll give it a 
              real shot first. The members who stick around for 30 days 
              almost never leave.
