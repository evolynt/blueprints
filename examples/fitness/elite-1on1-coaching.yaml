                      1. **Write down your goals** - Be specific. What do you want to achieve in the next 12 weeks? 6 months? Year?
                      
                      2. **Know your "why"** - Why is this important to you right now? What changes when you achieve this goal?
                      
                      3. **Be honest about your situation** - Current fitness level, time constraints, past attempts. The more honest you are, the better I can help.
                      
                      4. **Prepare your questions** - What do you want to know about the program, the process, or working together?
                      
                      5. **Be ready to commit** - If we're a good fit, be prepared to make a decision. Spots are limited and fill quickly.
                      
                      I'm looking forward to speaking with you!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              I noticed you applied for Elite 1:1 Coaching a few days ago 
              but haven't booked your Strategy Call yet.
              
              I wanted to check in because:
              
              **1. Spots are limited**
              I only work with a small number of 1:1 clients at a time to 
              ensure everyone gets my full attention. Right now, I have 
              availability, but that can change quickly.
              
              **2. Momentum matters**
              The fact that you took time to apply tells me you're serious 
              about your fitness goals. Don't let that momentum fade. The 
              sooner we talk, the sooner you can start seeing results.
              
              **3. There's no obligation**
              The Strategy Call is simply a conversation. We'll discuss 
              your goals, I'll share how I can help, and you can decide 
              if it's right for you. No pressure, no hard sell.
              
              If now isn't the right time, I understand. But if you're 
              ready to take your fitness to the next level, let's talk.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Great news! Your Strategy Call is confirmed.
              
              Check your calendar for the date, time, and Zoom link.
              
              **How to prepare for our call:**
              
              **1. Write down your goals**
              Be specific. What do you want to achieve? By when? Why does 
              this matter to you?
              
              **2. Know your obstacles**
              What's been holding you back? What have you tried before? 
              The more honest you are, the more I can help.
              
              **3. Clear your schedule**
              Give yourself 5 minutes before the call to get settled. 
              Find a quiet place where we can talk without interruptions.
              
              **4. Be ready to commit**
              If we're a good fit, I'll invite you to join the program. 
              Be prepared to make a decision. Serious applicants don't 
              wait around, and neither do serious coaches.
              
              I'm looking forward to our conversation!

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've been in Elite 1:1 Coaching for a week now. How's it 
              going?
              
              Quick check-in:
              
              ✓ Have you booked (or completed) your first coaching session?
              ✓ Have you introduced yourself in the community?
              ✓ Have you reviewed your personalized program?
              
              If you answered "no" to any of these, no judgment. But let's 
              get you back on track.
              
              **Remember why you're here.**
              
              You invested in yourself because you're serious about results. 
              The clients who get the best outcomes are the ones who engage 
              fully: booking sessions, asking questions, and showing up 
              consistently.
              
              If anything is unclear or you're feeling stuck, post in the 
              community or reply to this email. That's what I'm here for.
              
              Let's make week 2 even better!
