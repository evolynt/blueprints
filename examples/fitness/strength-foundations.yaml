                  For this program, you'll need access to:
                  
                  - A barbell (standard 45lb/20kg Olympic bar is ideal)
                  - Weight plates (start light - you can always add more)
                  - A squat rack or power cage
                  - A flat bench
                  
                  Most commercial gyms have all of this equipment. If you're 
                  training at home, we'll cover alternatives in each lesson.

                  Now that you know the movements, here's how to structure 
                  your first two weeks of training:
                  
                  **Week 1: Learning Phase**
                  - Day 1: Squat & Bench Press (3 sets of 8, light weight)
                  - Day 2: Rest
                  - Day 3: Deadlift & Overhead Press (3 sets of 8, light weight)
                  - Day 4: Rest
                  - Day 5: Squat & Barbell Row (3 sets of 8, light weight)
                  
                  **Week 2: Building Confidence**
                  - Repeat the same schedule
                  - Add small amounts of weight if form feels solid
                  - Focus on consistency, not intensity
                  
                  Remember: The goal these two weeks is to build movement 
                  patterns, not to lift heavy. Keep the weight light enough 
                  that your form stays perfect on every rep.

                      You walk into the gym, head over to the free weights section, and immediately feel lost.
                      
                      You've watched YouTube videos, but when you're actually standing in front of the barbell, you have no idea if you're about to build muscle or destroy your lower back.
                      
                      You see other people lifting with confidence and wonder: "What do they know that I don't?"
                      
                      Maybe you've even tried lifting before, but that nagging voice in your head keeps asking: "Am I doing this right? Is this going to hurt me?"
                      
                      So you stick to the machines. Or the treadmill. Or you skip the gym entirely.
                      
                      Every week that passes is another week of wasted potential.

                      Most fitness content shows you WHAT to do, but never teaches you HOW to know if you're doing it right.
                      
                      You can watch a hundred squat tutorials, but if you don't understand what "right" actually feels like in YOUR body, you'll never have confidence in your form.
                      
                      That's why I created Strength Training Foundations.
                      
                      This isn't just another "here's how to squat" video. It's a complete system that teaches you to feel the difference between good form and bad form, so you can self-correct without needing a trainer watching your every rep.

                      I recommend starting with the Welcome module, then working through one movement per day. By this time next week, you'll have a solid grasp of all 5 essential lifts.
                      
                      See you inside.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Thanks for joining Strength Training Foundations. You now have 
              access to complete video instruction for the 5 essential 
              barbell movements.
              
              Here's how to get the most out of this course:
              
              1. Start with the Welcome module to understand the program
              2. Work through one movement per day
              3. Practice with light weight before adding load
              
              Take your time. There's no rush. The goal is to build a 
              foundation you can rely on for years to come.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              You've had a week with the Strength Training Foundations 
              course. How's it going?
              
              By now, you should have worked through at least a few of the 
              movement tutorials. If you haven't had a chance yet, that's 
              okay. Life happens. The course isn't going anywhere.
              
              A few things to keep in mind as you practice:
              
              - Light weight is your friend right now
              - Film yourself if you can to check your form
              - Feeling awkward is normal when learning new movements
              
              Keep at it. You're building skills that will serve you for 
              the rest of your life.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              It's been two weeks since you started Strength Training 
              Foundations. By now, you should have a solid understanding 
              of the 5 essential barbell movements.
              
              So what's next?
              
              The foundation you've built is exactly that: a foundation. 
              Now it's time to build on it with progressive programming, 
              nutrition guidance, and ongoing accountability.
              
              If you're ready to take your training to the next level, 
              I offer 1:1 coaching where I design a personalized program 
              based on your goals and schedule.
              
              Reply to this email if you'd like to learn more.
