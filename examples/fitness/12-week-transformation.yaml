                      You've tried before. Maybe dozens of times.
                      
                      You start strong. The first week feels great. You meal prep, hit the gym, feel motivated.
                      
                      Then... life happens.
                      
                      - A stressful week at work and you skip a few workouts
                      - A social event derails your nutrition
                      - The scale stops moving and you lose motivation
                      
                      Before you know it, you're back where you started. Again.
                      
                      Here's the truth nobody tells you:
                      
                      **The problem isn't you. It's the approach.**
                      
                      Random workouts don't create transformations. Strict diets don't create lasting change. Motivation fades.
                      
                      What DOES work? A proven system with built-in accountability.

                      It's a complete transformation system that combines:
                      
                      **Structured Programming** - No guessing what to do. Every workout is planned for the full 12 weeks, progressively building on the previous phase.
                      
                      **Nutrition That Works** - Not a restrictive diet. Real strategies you can follow for life.
                      
                      **Community Accountability** - A private group of people on the same journey. Daily check-ins. Shared wins. Support when you need it.
                      
                      The result? People who follow this system don't just get results. They keep them.

              Hey {{contact.name}},
              
              You've got one week under your belt. That's huge!
              
              The first week is often the hardest. You're building new 
              habits, learning new movements, and pushing through the 
              initial discomfort. If you made it through, you're already 
              ahead of most people who try to get in shape.
              
              Quick check-in questions:
              
              1. Did you complete all your workouts this week?
              2. Have you been posting in the community?
              3. Are you following the nutrition guidelines?
              
              If you answered "no" to any of these, that's okay. Don't 
              beat yourself up. Just recommit right now.
              
              The people who transform aren't the ones who never miss a 
              day. They're the ones who get back on track quickly.
              
              Week 2 is where momentum starts to build. Keep going!

              Take a moment to appreciate how far you've come:
              
              - 6 weeks of consistent training
              - Dozens of workouts completed
              - New habits that are becoming automatic
              - A community of people who've watched you grow
              
              This is usually where the magic starts to happen.
              
              The foundation is built. The momentum is rolling. The 
              second half is where the visible transformation accelerates.
              
              **Time for a progress check:**
              
              1. Take new photos (same angles as your "before" shots)
              2. Record your current measurements
              3. Compare to where you started
              
              Even if the changes feel small, put them side by side. 
              You'll be surprised at what 6 weeks of consistency creates.
              
              The finish line is in sight. Let's make these final 6 weeks 
              the strongest yet.
