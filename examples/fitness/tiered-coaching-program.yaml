              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              A few days ago, you signed up to learn about lasting 
              transformation.
              
              I'm curious: what's holding you back?
              
              Maybe you've tried programs before that didn't work. Maybe 
              you're not sure if now is the right time. Maybe you're 
              wondering if this is any different from everything else 
              out there.
              
              I get it. Those are valid concerns.
              
              Here's what I can tell you:
              
              Transform Fitness Academy isn't a workout app or a generic 
              PDF program. It's real coaching with real accountability.
              
              We offer three tiers to fit different needs and budgets:
              
              - Silver: Group coaching with weekly calls and community
              - Gold: Group coaching plus 6 private 1:1 sessions
              - Platinum: The full experience with 12 private sessions
              
              If you're serious about making a change, fill out an 
              application. We'll hop on a call and figure out together 
              if this is right for you.
              
              No pressure. Just a conversation.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              I noticed you applied to Transform Fitness Academy but 
              haven't booked your Strategy Call yet.
              
              I want to make sure you don't miss this opportunity.
              
              **Why book the call:**
              
              ✓ Get clarity on which tier (Silver, Gold, or Platinum) is 
                right for your goals
              ✓ Ask any questions you have about the program
              ✓ Find out if we're a good fit to work together
              
              The call is 30 minutes. No obligation. Just a conversation.
              
              But I can only take a limited number of clients, and spots 
              do fill up. Don't wait too long.

              Hi {{contact.name}},
              
              Two weeks into your transformation! Let me ask you something:
              
              Are you using the community?
              
              I've noticed that the members who get the BEST results are 
              the ones who engage in the community regularly.
              
              Why? Because fitness isn't just about reps and calories. 
              It's about accountability. Support. Having people who get it.
              
              Here are a few ways to get more from the community:
              
              **1. Post your workouts** - Share what you did today. Others 
              will cheer you on.
              
              **2. Share your wins** - Big or small, celebrate them. And 
              celebrate others' wins too.
              
              **3. Ask questions** - Stuck on something? Post it. Someone's 
              been there.
              
              **4. Find an accountability partner** - Use the Accountability 
              Partners space to connect with someone on a similar journey.
              
              You're not alone in this. Lean into the community.
